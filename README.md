mango
=====
[Draft]
Mango is a Task Manager in Mongo DB using docopt facilty for commandline.
It is a simple way to schedule jobs.

Error of parameters are managed by docopt, Mango is agnostic about parameters given by the user.
Except for dispatch that has a different behaviour acording to method called.

How does it works?
 
Create a initial project with the parameters needed that is stored and executed later with the parameters needed
